# TheBlight by Team Blight

A small game project we created for our Game Programming class!

## Description
The game takes place in a world where the Irish Famine, caused by a deadly crop disease called the blight, has turned into something much worse. The blight, which destroyed the potato crop, the main food for millions, caused people who ate the infected potatoes to become twisted, monstrous versions of themselves. Battle the creatures that were once human, and face the destruction that left millions starving and forced to leave their homes. Will you be able to make it out alive?

## Features
- Roll for strong perks to beat the blighted
- Fight waves of the blighted in each level!
- Collect potatoes from the blight to spend in the Gacha Shop!
- Beat the boss to aboard the ship!
